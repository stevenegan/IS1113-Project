          <p>My interest in cloud computing has grown immensely since I began in University College. The reason cloud computing has an impact on me is the fact that I now use cloud computing services to upload, store and keep all my notes and files for college safe. One of my favourite would be gmail as it is one of the most common used. Cloud Computing is hugely fascinating as it's currently the hot topic in IT management world of technology. The ability to store, run and save data files and being able to use from almost any smart device is very interesting. Cloud was invented in the late 1960's but wasn't properly introduced until 2006 and since then the industry in cloud has progressed in a highly positive manner. Cloud is now used all over the world and I myself have now gained further knowledge in cloud Services and find its extremely useful. Companies data is stored on Cloud and the competition between different host services such as Amazon, Google, Cloud 9 etc has increased and these companies will continue to produce further technology into Cloud Services which will be interesting to see in the near future.<p>
